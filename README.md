# Car-Dictionary
Car-Dictionsary is a simple dictionary thats prompts a user for input of a car manufacturer. Once a car manufacturer has been entered, the manufacturers most popular cars will be printed along with the average maintenance cost. 
For me this was just a cool project I put together for my interest and love for cars. I think this can also be useful for someone who is looking to purchase a new car as this dictionary provides information on pricing and how maintence cost could roughly look like for some of these manufactures.
