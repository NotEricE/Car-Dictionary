# Car-Dictionary
Car-Dictionsary is a simple dictionary thats prompts a user for input of a car manufacturer. Once a car manufacturer has been entered, the manufacturers most popular cars will be printed along with the average maintenance cost. this can also be useful for someone who is looking to purchase a new car as this dictionary provides information on pricing and how maintence cost could roughly look like for some of these manufactures.
For me this was just a cool project I put together for my interest and love for cars.

* Update 1.0 *
Updated project design to reduce the lines of code in the main program. main_car_dict.py is the main program file where users are prompted for an input and get a value in return
